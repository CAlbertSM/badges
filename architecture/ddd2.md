# Architecture Apprentice 2

A developer who can build well-architected systems in a Domain-Driven Design context.

## Master the following skills:


1. 10% - DDD Lite, Awareness  
  * The Goal of DDD
  * Ubiquitous Language (naming things)
  * Separation of domain code / project structure
  * Repositories
  * Services
  * Dependency Injection
  * Entities with ORM
  * Code-First vs DB-First
  
2. Strategic
  * DDD is for non-technical people 1st
  * Bounded Context
  * Ubiquitous Language
  * Context Maps
    * Shared Kernel
    * Customer/Supplier
    * Conformist
    * Partner
    * Anti-Corruption Layer
  * Domain Modeling

3. Tactical
  * Entities
  * Encapsulation (invariants, mutability)
  * Rich Domain Model vs Anemic Model
  * Value Objects
  * Aggregates
  * Services
  * Repositories
  * Factories
  * Events
  * Modules

4. Advanced
  * Context communication

* Define domain
* List 5 examples of domains in software
* Differentiate between a core domain and a supporting or sub-domain
* Defend the need for a ubiquitous language between technical and business teams
* Describe a bounded context and how it relates to domains
* Formulate questions at the business level that help reveal bounded contexts
* Discuss 3 possibilities for communication between bounded contexts
* Describe the process of domain modeling
* Design a domain model with at least 10 components

* Differentiate between strategic and tactical Domain-Driven Design
* Differentiate between a value object and an entity
* Demonstrate value objects in code
* Demonstrate domain entities in code
* Differentiate between aggregates and entities
* Demonstrate an aggregate root with entities and value objects together in code
* Write encapsulated entities with no public setters


* Defend the need for a strategy like DDD to build well-architected systems
* Define domain

* Defend the need to protect your code from abuse by other developers

* Describe invariants
* Differentiate between domain and data models
* Defend the need for code-first database design over database-first design

## Evaluation:

Ask your mentor if you are ready for evaluation. Then, do one of the following:

1. Schedule a live evaluation by clicking [here](http://evals.codex.academy) to find a time on the calendar. After the evaluation, claim the badge.

or

2. Record a screencast where you talk about and demonstrate each competency listed above. Make sure badge criteria and relevant tools are visible in the screen cast AND that your audio is good enough for the evaluator to hear. Upload the video to a service like Vimeo or Youtube (unlisted is fine) so that you can provide a public url for an evaluator to view. Claim the badge and include the video url in the evidence box.
