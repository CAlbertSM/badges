* Implement front-end login that uses Google OAuth login
* Implement front-end login that uses Facebook OAuth login


Level 4 -OIDC
* Differentiate between authentication and authorization
* Compare/Contrast OAuth and OpenID Connect
* Understand what elements OpenID Connect adds to the OAuth 2.0 scene


Level 5 - Advanced



* Use "OpenID Connect Debugger" (oidcdebugger.com) to test an OpenID Connect Provider
* Use a JWT decoder to view the contents of a Json Web Token
* Describe the anatomy of a JWT
* Use the signature to verify the authenticity of a JWT

* Describe the ideal OpenID Connect and OAuth flow for a SPA website (ex: React)

* Implement auth with a 3rd party IDP like Okta or Auth0.

IDP:
* Implement a simple identity provider by hand (no OAuth/OIDC libraties)
* Implement an identity provider using a popular OIDC library

OIDC Consumer Servers:
* Implement a server that can intercept a JWT bearer token and grant or deny access to the application based on it's validity
* Implement a server that can intercept a JWT bearer token and grant or deny permissions to the application's features based on it's claims
* Decode JWT to inspect and utilize claims

* Add a Google Sign-In to an existing web application and implement a hybridized client/server flow
* Add a User model/table to your database to store the credentials collected from the OAuth provider's API
* Define permissions in an application database to complement authentication
* Limit access of the application for each logged in user based on permissions

* Implement multiple OAuth providers in a web application
* Add Facebook Login as an alternative sign in option for your users

* Implement forms authentication

## Evaluation:

Ask your mentor if you are ready for evaluation. Then, do one of the following:

1. Schedule a live evaluation by clicking [here](http://evals.codex.academy) to find a time on the calendar. After the evaluation, claim the badge.

or

2. Record a screencast where you talk about and demonstrate each competency listed above. Make sure badge criteria and relevant tools are visible in the screen cast AND that your audio is good enough for the evaluator to hear. Upload the video to a service like Vimeo or Youtube (unlisted is fine) so that you can provide a public url for an evaluator to view. Claim the badge and include the video url in the evidence box.
